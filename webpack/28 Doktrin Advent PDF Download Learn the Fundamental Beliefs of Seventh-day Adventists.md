The 28 doctrines of the Seventh-day Adventist Church are:
 
1. Scripture. The Bible is the inspired word of God, given by divine inspiration through holy men who spoke and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. In this word, God has given to humanity the knowledge necessary for salvation. The Scripture is the authoritative revealer of doctrines, the trustworthy record of God's acts in history, and the standard for character and experience. (2 Pet 1:20, 21; 2 Tim 3:16, 17; Ps 119:105; Prov 30:5, 6; Isa 8:20; John 17:17; 1 Thess 2:13; Heb 4:12).
2. Trinity. There is one God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, a unity of three coeternal Persons. God is eternal, omnipotent, omniscient, supreme and infinite. He is beyond human comprehension, yet He is known through His self-revelation. He is forever worthy of worship, adoration, and service by the whole creation. (Deut 6:4; Matt 28:19; 2 Cor 13:14; Eph 4:4-6; 1 Pet 1:2; 1 Tim 1:17; Rev 14:7).
3. God the Father. God the eternal Father is the Creator, Source, Sustainer and Sovereign of all creation. He is just and holy, merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. The qualities and powers exhibited in the Son and the Holy Spirit are also revelations of the Father. (Gen 1:1; Rev 4:11; 1 Cor 15:28; John 3:16; 1 John 4:8; 1 Tim 1:17; Exod 34:6, 7; John 14:9)
4. God the Son. God the eternal Son became incarnate in Jesus Christ. Through Him all things were created, the character of God is revealed, the salvation of humanity is accomplished, and the world is judged. Forever truly God, He became also truly human. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He lived and experienced temptation as a human being, but perfectly exemplified the righteousness and love of God.
5. God the Holy Spirit. God the eternal Spirit was active with the Father and the Son in Creation, incarnation, and redemption. He inspired the writers of Scripture. He filled Christ's life with power. He draws and convicts human beings; and those who respond He renews and transforms into the image of God.
6. Creation. God is Creator of all things, and has revealed in Scripture the authentic account of His creative activity. In six days the Lord made "the heaven and the earth" and all living things upon the earth.
7. The Nature of Humanity. Man and woman were made in the image of God with individuality, the power and freedom to think and to do.
8. The Great Controversy. All humanity is now involved in a great controversy between Christ and Satan regarding the character of God, His law, and His sovereignty over the universe.
9. The Life, Death, and Resurrection of Christ. In Christ's life of perfect obedience to God's will, His suffering, death, and resurrection.
10. The Experience of Salvation. In infinite love and mercy God made Christ our substitute and surety.
11. Growing in Christ. By His death on the cross Jesus triumphed over evil forces.
12. The Church. The church is a community of believers who confess Jesus Christ as Lord.
13. The Remnant and Its Mission. The universal church is composed of all who truly believe in Christ.
14. Unity in

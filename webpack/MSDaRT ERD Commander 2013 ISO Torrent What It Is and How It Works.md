MSDaRT is a collection of utilities that can help you troubleshoot and repair various Windows problems, such as corrupted files, registry errors, malware infections, password resets, and more. MSDaRT can be run from a bootable CD/DVD or USB drive, so you can access your system even if it does not start normally.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download MSDaRT, create a bootable media, and use some of its features to repair your Windows system.
  
## How to Download MSDaRT
 
MSDaRT is part of the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP), which is a suite of software tools for enterprise customers who have a volume license agreement with Microsoft. MDOP is not available for retail or OEM customers.
 
If you have a valid volume license agreement, you can download MDOP from the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC) website. You will need to sign in with your Microsoft account and provide your license information. Once you are logged in, you can find MDOP under the Software Assurance section.
 
The latest version of MDOP is 2015, which includes MSDaRT 10 for Windows 10, MSDaRT 8.1 for Windows 8.1, and MSDaRT 8 for Windows 8. You can also download older versions of MDOP that support previous versions of Windows, such as MSDaRT 7 for Windows 7 and MSDaRT 6.5 for Windows Vista and XP.
 
After you download the MDOP ISO file, you will need to extract it using a tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will find several folders inside the ISO file, each containing a different version of MSDaRT. Choose the one that matches your Windows system and open it.
  
## How to Create a Bootable Media with MSDaRT
 
To create a bootable media with MSDaRT, you will need a blank CD/DVD or USB drive with at least 4 GB of space. You will also need a tool like Rufus or WinToBootic to write the MSDaRT image to the media.

After you select the ISO file, click on Start or Create to begin writing the image to your media. Wait until the process is completed and then eject your media safely.
  
## How to Use MSDaRT to Repair Your Windows System
 
To use MSDaRT to repair your Windows system, you will need to boot your computer from the media that you created in the previous step. To do this, you may need to change the boot order in your BIOS or UEFI settings or use a boot menu key to select your media as the first boot device.
 
Once you boot from your media, you will see a welcome screen with two options: Run DaRT Tools or Exit DaRT Tools. Choose Run DaRT Tools to launch MSDaRT.
 
You will then see a list of tools that you can use to diagnose and repair your Windows system. Some of these tools are:
